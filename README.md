## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the R-Tree data structure in C using the CodeBlocks IDE. R-Trees are tree data structures used for indexing multi-dimensional information such as geographical coordinates, rectangles, and polygons. This implementation also includes a visualization component utilizing the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library to help understand the structure and behavior of R-Trees.

## Features
- Efficient R-Tree data structure implementation.
- Insertion and Search of multi-dimensional objects.
- Range searching and nearest neighbor search.
- Visualization of the R-Tree structure using SDL.
- Interactive interface to visualize and manipulate the R-Tree.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- [CodeBlocks IDE](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads)
- [SDL2 Library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yashrp2004/-DSA-Project_R-Tree_Implementation.git
    ```

2. **Install SDL2**
    - Follow the [installation guide](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) for your operating system.

3. **Open the Project in CodeBlocks**
    - Launch CodeBlocks and open the `rtree.cbp` project file.

4. **Build and Run**
    - Build the project using CodeBlocks.
    - Run the executable to start the application.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can:
- Insert rectangles into the R-Tree.
- Perform range searches and visualize the results.
- Perform nearest neighbor searche and visualize the results.
- Observe the structure of the R-Tree as it dynamically updates.
